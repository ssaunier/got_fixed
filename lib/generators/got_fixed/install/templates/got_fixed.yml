# You should use Resque to send emails to user. Just make sure the "resque"
# gem is in your Gemfile, and uncomment the following.
# resque:
#   queue: mail  # Queue used by the GotFixed::NotifyUserOfClosedIssueJob

# Github repositories exposed on the got_fixed dashboard.
# - For private repos, create a personal access token here: https://github.com/settings/applications
# - The webhook secret is something you can generate by hand. It is something you share with
#   GitHub to make sure that only Github can update your issue database.

# Example:
#
# github:
#   - owner: ssaunier
#     repo: got_fixed_demo
#     labels: "demo"  # Comma-separated labels for github issues to be shown on dashboard
#     access_token: <%= ENV['GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'] %>
#     webhook_secret: <%= ENV['GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET'] %>
#   - owner: ssaunier
#     repo: dotfiles
#     labels: ""
#     access_token: <%= ENV['GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'] %>
#     webhook_secret: <%= ENV['GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET'] %>
